##### Additional features
Additional 3 firewalls: Firewalls are established on each server to
filter traffic to ensure only authorised connections are allowed.

Additional SSL cerificate: Ensures use of HTTPS protocol which encrypts data
during the connection.

Additional 3 Monitoring clients: The monitoring client checks that the servers are
functioning optimally and notify if something is wrong and needs attention.
The Monitoring client works by collecting data and sending it to the monitoring system.

##### Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS ?
The monitoring client is configured to collect QPS data, sends a notification if QPS is
below threshhold.

##### Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue ?
Its an issue because the traffic between the load balancer and the web servers is unencrypted

##### Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue ?
This is because if the primary server goes down, data can no longer be written

##### Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem
Having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server)
might be a problem because their consumption will not grow the same way between
each of them (we might want to have more database servers than application servers for instance).

Also there could be an issue when there is maintenance performed on a server for
a specific component, it will affect other components that are on it

##### Issues

The load balncer remains the SPOF as it has no redundancy
