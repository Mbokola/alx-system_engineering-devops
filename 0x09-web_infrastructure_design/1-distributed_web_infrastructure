##### Additional features
Additional two servers: Extra servers offer redundancy in case of Failure.
Additional load balancer: Distributes workload evenly between the two servers.
In this implementation the Active-Active setup is implemented using weighted Round
robin algorithim ensuring effecient use of available resources.

##### How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works
The database Primary-Replica works by scynchronising data from the primary database
hence having upto date data.
The primary database node differs with the replica by allowing read/write
while the Replica node can only allow reads.

### Infrastructure issues of this implementation:

SPOF: The single point of failure is the load-balancer. If it fails the setup fails.

The setup also lacks security features such as HTTPS and firewalls which can be expose
the web app to infiltration.
Traffic via HTTP is unencrypted, thus i plain text, a hacker can intercept data, which
can be harmful when dealing with sensitive data sach as credit numbers etc.
Firewalls on the other hand filter traffic to ensure only authorised connections are
allowed.

The setup also lacks monitoring features, which play a role of observing and notifying
on server performance.
