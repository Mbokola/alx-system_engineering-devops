##### What is the role of the web server ?
The web server handles incoming requests from web clients (usually web browsers)
and respond by delivering static web content, which can be in the form of web pages,
images, videos, files, or any other data that the client has requested.

##### What is the role of the application server ?

TCP/IP stack
These protocols define how data is formatted and transmitted between the client
(user's computer, typically a web browser) and the server.

##### Explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:
SPOF: This infrustructure does not offer any kind of redundancy, a failure in
one component will result in the failure of all other components.

The downtime will depend on how long maintenance  activities take. There will be
temporary service interruption to users:

The infrustructure also won't scale well if there's too much incoming traffic, since
it does not provide support mechanisims when the load is high, therefore becoming
susceptible to crashes and slow response times.
